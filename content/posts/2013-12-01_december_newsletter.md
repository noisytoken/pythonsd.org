[Local groups provide inside track to tech jobs][local-groups] (utsandiego.com) <br />
The Union Tribune had an article about local tech groups (like us!) providing
the inside track to jobs. I don't know how much of an inside track it is, but
San Diego Python certainly doesn't hurt! The article features the
[Ansir Center][ansir-center], our usual host.

[Data visualization with Bokeh][bokeh] (pydata.org) <br />
If you're a data visualization nut like I am, then you'll find Bokeh from
ContinuumIO quite interesting. It's an open source Python based interactive
data visualization tool. Now all we need is an expert to give a presentation
at a San Diego Python meetup.

Upcoming events
---------------

[Hack Night 2013][hack-night] (meetup.com) <br />
Instead of our usual monthly meetup -- the fourth Thursday of December is 12/26
-- by "popular" demand we will be having a hack night at Regent's Pizzeria in
UTC. The date is locked in for Friday the 13th of December. Bring the project
you're working on and show it off. We'll also have an overview of GitHub and a
sign-up party for the uninitiated. If we get enought demand, we'll have an
introduction to deploying websites on Heroku. See you there.
