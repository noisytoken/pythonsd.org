We had 40 people attend our
[Test-Driven Django Development workshop][django-tdd-workshop] last weekend.
Thanks to the [Python Software Foundation][psf] for sponsoring this event and
thanks to the [Ansir Innovation Center][aicenter] for providing the venue! The
feedback on the event was extremely positive.

In case you missed our event or if you want to run your own Django
test-driven development workshop, we have made all of our
[workshop tutorials][workshop-tutorials] available online. The sources are
up on [github][github] and we intend to continue to improve these so that
they can be reused in another workshop.
