Hola Pythoneers,

Did you know that San Diego Python has an IRC channel? There are some nice
folks happy to help or just chat in [#sandiegopython][irc] on Freenode.

Upcoming events
---------------


[Saturday study group][saturday-meetup] (meetup.com) <br />
San Diego Python and PyLadies are continuing the Saturday study group at
Pangea cafe. The goal of the Saturday study group is to learn Python together
in a collaborative environment. There's talk about a Scientific Python Study
Group as well for this month but I don't want to spoil too much yet.

[San Diego Python monthly meetup][monthly-meetup] (meetup.com) <br />
Our regular monthly meetup will be held at the Ansir Innovation Center on
Thursday July 24. We are going to continue our five minute (ish) talks format
which worked reasonably well at the last meetup. If you are interested in
speaking, please contact us.
