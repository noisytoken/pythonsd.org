Pythonistas,


San Diego Python is looking to put together a short series of workshops and
study group sessions this Summer as a companion to edX/HarveyMuddX's course
[CS For All: Introduction to Computer Science and Python Programming][cs-4-all].
The course (as well as SD Python workshops) is free although edX will add a
verified course certificate for $50.
If you're interested in taking the course or helping with the workshops,
please chime in in the [discussion forum][].

is starting a bit later on the 20th and 27th of this month due to a scheduling
conflict.
