Pythonistas,


Udemy has made a special offer to our members. They have a new class entitled
[Python GUI Programming][]. The course is normally $79 but the first 50 people
who use the coupon code "pythonsd.org" would get free access to the course.
They're hoping that by getting started on a free course that you become
lifelong students. If you signup, please share about your experience. If we get
a good group of folks taking the course, perhaps the Saturday study group
could be a useful place to compare notes.

This excellent and fun course has just started again. Join Diane, Maggie, Rebecca, Alain, Eric, Gopal, Jaime, Juan, Kyle, Peter and many others at each Saturday Study Group (see above) as we take, or retake, this class. Sure, we'll improve our collection of python made video-games! Also we'll master the skills of interactive programming with python to the point of teaching others.
