[Saturday study group][saturday-meetup] (meetup.com) <br />
San Diego Python and PyLadies are continuing the Saturday study group at
Pangea cafe. The goal of the Saturday study group is to learn Python together
in a collaborative environment. There's talk about a Scientific Python Study
Group as well for July but I don't want to spoil too much yet.
