Hey Pythonistas,

Over the last year, you have helped San Diego Python grow from under 500
members to almost 800 members today. San Diego PyLadies has more than
doubled in size to over 150 members. The meetups are better attended, and
more importantly, more local developers are participating, speaking, working
together and asking questions of their peers. Thanks to you our members!

This month's meetup which is replacing the usual monthly meetup will be
