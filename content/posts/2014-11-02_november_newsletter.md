Pythoneers,

After a bit of a hiatus, the monthly newsletter is back!

First of all, a bit of housekeeping is in order. There will be a few changes
to the schedule of the San Diego Python monthly meetup for the next two months.
Our usual 4th Thursday schedule would mean a meetup on Thanksgiving and on
Christmas. Instead, we will be having our Django One-Day Unconference on
**November 15** and a casual meetup on **December 12**. Neither of these are
at the usual spot, so make sure to check meetup.com.


Upcoming events
---------------


[Saturday study group][saturday-meetup] (meetup.com) <br />
San Diego PyLadies and SD Python are continuing the Saturday study group
at Pangea cafe. The goal of the Saturday study group is to learn Python
together in a collaborative environment. Thanks to all that have been
helping out and participating. It's been fun and helpful.

[Django One-Day Unconference][django-oneday] (meetup.com) <br />
[Brightscope][] is sponsoring a Django One-Day Unconference, a
participant-driven event where every attendee is encouraged to present
or just have a conversation on a topic of their choice. While we are
suggesting a Python/Django focus for talks, there is no requirement. This
event is free and will be at Brightscope's UTC office on November 15.
