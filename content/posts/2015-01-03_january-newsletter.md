Happy New Year,

Just before New Year's we crossed the 800 member milestone!

We are looking to have a cross-disciplinary (Python, R, Kline and Weka)
data science workshop in late February or early March. We are actively seeking
docents to help tutor and guide people interested in learning about data
science. If you are open to help, please [email us][email-us].

[email-us]: mailto:sandiegopython@gmail.com

It is that time of the year again where we need to renew the San Diego
Python and SD PyLadies meetup.com membership. If you love the workshops,
events and material you get from San Diego Python, please consider a
[donation][].
