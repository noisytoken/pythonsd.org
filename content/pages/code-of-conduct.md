Title: Code of Conduct

## Suggested Social Rules

These suggestions should help you avoid alienating those around you.  All are welcome in our community and we want everyone to know it.

- Try to avoid us vs. them statements.  Some of your audience members might consider themselves in your "them" group.
- Avoid phrases like "obviously" and "anyone can see that".  What may be apparent to you, may not be for your audience.  These phrases can re-enforce the imposter syndrome that many of us experience.
- Keep criticism positive by avoiding senseless bashing.  Always assume one of the users or authors of the language/library/technology you're discussing is in your audience.
