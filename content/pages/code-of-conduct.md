Title: Code of Conduct

## Avoid Exclusivity

- Try to avoid us vs. them statements.  Some of your audience members might consider themselves in your them group.
- Avoid imposter syndrome-causing phrases like "obviously" and "anyone can see that".  What may be obvious to you, may not be to your audience.
- Try to avoid senseless bashing.  One of the users or authors of the library/language/technology that you're bashing may be in your audience.
