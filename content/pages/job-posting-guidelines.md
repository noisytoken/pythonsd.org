Title: Job Posting Guidelines


Would you like to get your job posting in front of over 700 local developers?
Here are the steps and guidelines for posting your open position:

* The job posting must relate to Python in some way. This is the San Diego
  **Python** group after all.
* The job must be available to someone living in the greater San Diego area.
  Commutable parts of Orange and Riverside counties as well as remote jobs
  are all OK.
* The subject line must make it clear that it is a job posting.
* Please be clear whether this is a full-time or part-time job.

Once you've crafted your job posting, send it in an email to
[PythonSD-list@meetup.com][email] from the same address you used to join the
[Meetup.com group][meetup-group]. These postings work best without attachments.
There's a slight delay as all messages require approval.

[email]: mailto:PythonSD-list@meetup.com

San Diego Python also sends out a newsletter on a monthly basis that includes
job postings. If you would like your job posting featured in our newsletter,
please send it to [sandiegopython@gmail.com][]. See the
[newsletter from June 2014][june-newsletter] for an example of a past
newsletter.

Posting a job opening is free but if you find excellent developers through
San Diego Python, please consider a [donation][] to San Diego Python. Your
tax deductible donations go entirely toward running our periodic workshops.
