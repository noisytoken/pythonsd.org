Title: Chat Room

Meetup events aren't the only time for chatting.  There's also a #sandiegopython IRC channel on Freenode.

Sign on to ask questions, give answers, or just hang out.

This page contains instructions for signing onto the IRC channel.

## Web Client

If you haven't used IRC before, the fastest way to start is by using the web client.  You don't need to install anything on your computer for this.

You'll need to choose a unique username and then you'll be put in the #sandiegopython channel on Freenode.  You can type by clicking in the text box at the bottom and using your keyboard.

[Visit the Web Client](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=sandiegopython)
